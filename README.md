# P-Plus: Pixel Prototyping & Production Platform for 3D media facades

P+ is an open-sourced test fit generative platform for the design of 3D media façades leveraging on recent practices observed in the field of architecture. It consists of a set of modular light cell components that can be assembled into a larger structure; a physical, 3D printing based prototyping kit; and a software tool for generation, testing and live running of façades fulfilling pre-defined contextual constraints.
